# Incidence-Report-Playbook
Every organization needs a structured course of action  when a vulnerability in a system is exploited and there is a threat to information security.


<h2>Description</h2>
An incident response playbook is a critical document that guides an organization through the process of managing and resolving security incidents.It is one of the documents that can be used to back up the information security policy of an organisation. This documents contains predefined actions, communication protocols, and roles and responsibilities for incident responders, ensuring a structured and efficient approach to incident management. The playbook is tailored to the organizationâ€™s specific environment, taking into account its systems, applications, and critical assets, which allows for a more effective response to various types of incidents such as data breaches, malware infections, denial-of-service attacks, and insider threats.

In addition to guiding the immediate response, the incident response playbook also serves as a reference for post-incident analysis and improvement. It helps document key theories and actions taken during an incident, facilitates communication between technical teams and management, and ensures that all stakeholders are informed and involved in the response process. By having a well-prepared incident response playbook, organizations can significantly reduce the impact of security incidents and maintain business continuity.
